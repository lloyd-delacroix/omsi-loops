            <b> Jan 23rd, 2023</b>
            • Writing update! Vera from Discord has contributed a ton of new action stories for content across the game.<br>
            • Tooltip updates from Quiaaaa to Spatiomancyy and Practical magic.<br>
            • Tooltip fixes from SyDr to hopefully resolve the age-old bug with tooltips going off-screen.<br>

            <b> July 25th, 2022</b>
            Performance Update!<br>
            With help from Hordex from Discord, we've rewritten most of the explicit update calls to be deferred to the update handler.<br>
            This means that most UI refreshes are now correctly controlled by the "Updates Per Second" setting in the options menu.<br>
            High level players who are still experiencing lag can significantly improve performance by reducing this number - this will only decrease how often the screen refreshes, not how often the game updates.<br>
            ---<br>
            Additionally, we have a number of new global stories for all the zones, action segments, and other updates from MrPitt!

            <b> July 25th, 2022</b>
            • A new guild has opened in Commerceville - Assassins Guild! Kill targets across the world, collect their hearts (why is it always hearts?), and return them to the guild to learn the ways of the assassin<br>
            • New Actions: Assassinate: Assassination targets are now available in every zone. Every assassination carries a very heavy reputation penalty (mitigated by assassin skill) and gets harder based on your reputation and number of assassinations completed this loop<br>
            • New Skill: Assassin - Improves assassination actions and reduces the difficultly scaling in trials<br>
            • New Menu: Totals - Records play metrics including total time played and loops/actions completed<br>
            • Balance: Thieves guild actions gold rewards x2<br>
            • New Option: Highlight New Actions - Places a border around actions that have not yet been completed on this save. Defaults to on, but can be toggled off in options<br>
            • Added max button to Gather Team<br>
            • Typo fixes

            <b> July 20th, 2022</b>
            • Survey Update! Survey is now completed using maps purchased in Beginnersville. Completed maps can be returned to the explorer's guild for extra progress in a random uncompleted area.<br>
            • A few minor bugfixes
            ]]></version>
            <version verNum="2.6"><![CDATA[

            • Dark Ritual now only shows speed increases for unlocked zones

            <version verNum="2.5"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 19th, 2022</b>
            • New Option: Stat Colors - Changes stat menu bars to be the same colors used in multipart action bars<br>
            • Removed Simple Tooltips Option - It was extra work to maintain on every update / change<br>
            • Bugfix: DR was not properly increasing zombie strength<br>
            • Balance: Added great feast's bonus to team members and zombies to bring team combat better in line with self combat (this seemed more interesting than just adding a flat x5, but may be changed later)

            <version verNum="2.4"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 20th, 2022</b>
            • Balance: Team combat buffs! Restoration now contributes 4x its level instead of 2x to team member strength<br>
            We'll see how this feels, and can revisit and improve leadership, too, if needed<br>
            • New Option: Players can now enable a setting to have the game automatically pause when a progress action reaches 100% so they can accrue bonus seconds rather than waste time on a loop making little progress<br>
            • Tooltip Updates: Many thanks to MakroCZ from the discord for tireless work on a fix for tooltip placement<br>
            • Tooltip Updates: Kallious from the discord has helped clarify a number of unlock conditions and tided up the tidy up action in Valhalla<br>
            • Bugfix: Imbue Soul could be started at max buff rank, resetting all progress for no reward<br>

            <version verNum="2.3"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 19th, 2022</b>
            • Bugfix: With thanks to Kallious from the Discord, we've finally fixed the bug sometimes making soulstones go negative on DR/IM/GF<br>
            • Bugfix: Added additional error checks to loading save files to autofix some of the common error states<br>
            • Bugfix: Trial of dead was not using updated zombie strength formula<br>
            • Bugfix: Imbue Soul was not updating training tooltips until next restart

            <version verNum="2.2"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 19th, 2022</b>
            • New Skill: Leadership - Increases your max follower count by 1 for every 100 levels and increases their contribution to team combat<br>
            • New Action (Commerceville): Motivational Seminar - Get advice from the head of a totally-not-an-MLM to learn how to be a better leader<br>
            • Balance: Zombie Strength is now increased by Dark Ritual / 100(min 1x, up to 6.66x increase)<br>
            • Balance: Fight Jungle Monsters now rewards blood instead of hides. Prepare Buffet is now made of blood instead of hide. Still gross.<br>
            Note - We'll have to see how these changes land. It may end up being that now Team Combat is too strong compared to self combat. Also, trials will almost certainly need rebalancing.<br>
            • Bugfix: Fight actions were giving exp on segment in addition to completion. Increased combat exp of frost/giants & jungle monsters to compensate<br>
            • Bugfix: Explorer's guild was not reducing the cost of excursion<br>
            ]]></version>

            <b> July 18th, 2022</b>

            • Balance: Reduced Alchemy Skill requirement of Looping potion from 500 to 200<br>
            • Balance: Jungle Escape now only needs to be started within 60s, not completed within 60s<br>
            • Bugfix: Excursion was requiring the player to have more gold than the cost rather than more or equal<br>
            • Bugfix: Troll's blood still said it did nothing<br>
            • Bugfix: Reduce the amount of time "Saved" appear on loadouts from 2s -> 1s<br>
            • Bugfix: Secret trial couldn't be started<br>
            • Bugfix: Soulstone display wasn't being updated after imbue soul<br>

            <version verNum="2.0"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 16th, 2022</b>
            Added Challenge Modes!<br>
            Challenges are super hard modifications to the base game with extra restrictions in place.<br>
            These are only for fun and do not give any rewards.<br>
            ]]></version>
            <version verNum="1.9"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 16th, 2022</b>
            • Change: Added "Max Training" button to bottom of action list that will cap all training actions present on the list. This button only appears after players have completed their first imbue mind to reduce clutter<br>

            • Bugfix: Off-by-One error in final trial was preventing players from being able to finish<br>
            • Bugfix: Trial tooltips were displaying incorrect floor numbers<br>
            • Bugfix: Trolls, Frost Giants, and Jungle Monsters were giving combat exp per action rather than per kill. These actions will likely need significant combat skill exp buffs after to compensate for this fix

            <version verNum="1.8"><![CDATA[
            <b> July 14th, 2022</b>
            • New Trial: Trial of the Dead (Startington) - Based solely off your Zombie contributions to team combat, completing floors rewards even more zombies<br>
            • Bugfix: Swapped the Clear List and Manage Loadout buttons so the loadout popup would be less likely to get in the way when editing action amounts<br>
            • Bugfix: Added survey icon to new actions added by survey so they are easier to notice<br>
            • Bugfix: Haul wasn't being properly capped per zone, allowing stones to become negative

            Endgame content complete!<br>
            The endgame has been reworked to be a series of a team trial, solo trial, and final action that must all be completed in order in a single loop.<br>
            This update marks the end of my planned content. From here out it'll be mostly balancing, bugfixes, and perhaps the occasional addition as whimsy strikes.<br>

                <q>What do stats do?</q>
                <a>Hover over "Stats" for how they work. What stats are important depend on what actions you need that
                    uses them. In general, higher stats mean more work done in a loop.

            <q_a>
                <q>Short runs seem better.</q>
                <a>Short runs are better for the early game, but as your runs get longer and you accrue
                    talent and soulstones, longer runs become more useful.
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>What should my first goal be?</q>
                <a>Start with wandering until you have ways of getting mana back. Then try to find how to get some
                    warrior lessons to give yourself a permanent boost, and then try fighting monsters!
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>How do skill increases / reductions work?</q>
                <a>Increases multiply a reward by (1 + level / 60) ^ .25, so you'll see diminishing returns at higher levels.
                Reductions multiply a cost by 1 / (1 + level / 100), so you'll never be able to bring a cost completely to zero.
                </a>
            </q_a>
            <q_a>
                <q>When should I use Dark Ritual?</q>
                <a>Many people recommend performing another ritual when the cost is less than 5% of your soulstones.
                Of course, the choice is up to you and there may be cases where it's better to perform it sooner or later.

            <story num="0"> <!--Beginning of Game-->
                You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town,
                you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you.
                Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana completely ran out, 
                you found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves
                filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you,
                until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are
                often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...
            </story>
            <story num="1"> <!--First Soulstone-->
                You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedestal. You've found the
                dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into
                you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a
                small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted
                that it will stay with you no matter when you are.
            </story>
            <story num="2"> <!--No Soulstone-->
                You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been
                thought that dungeon cores feed upon the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the
                essence of its previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to
                put more mana into the world to reap the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another
                oddity of the loops.
            </story>
			<story num="3"> <!--Change 3 to Forest-->
				After spending most of a loop preparing, you're finally ready to leave Beginnersville. In a way, you're
				going to miss this town, and the thought of leaving almost brings a tear to your eye - until you realize
				you'll just be back next loop. Grumbling, you set off, hiking into the forest. By the time you're
				ready to make camp, you're in a good mood again. The forest is beautiful, teeming with life, and looks
				to have boundless places to explore. Best of all, on your way here, you passed several locations that
				are absolutely saturated with mana - you think you'll check those out first.
		    </story>
		    <story num="4"> <!--Merchanton-->
				It's always nice, after doing the same dull tasks over and over, to make your way through the forest and 
                get to do something new. Whether you're exploring, hunting, learning something or just sitting by the 
                waterfall, the forest always makes a great backdrop. However, as pleasant as it's been here, it's time to 
                move on, at least for now. It would be a long trip, but luckily, after all your exploring, you know some 
                shortcuts, and before long, Merchanton emerges out of the trees. There's a lot to do here! Maybe one of 
                the guilds can help you with your looping problem! Or maybe there's a book in the library that can lead you 
                to a solution! Or maybe... or maybe... that all sounds like a lot of work, and you have been going through a
				lot lately. Maybe before any of that, you should find a bar and get a drink.
			</story>
			<story num="5"> <!--Change 5 to Mt. Olympus-->
				You have explored the guild options in Merchanton and have maybe made a few guild friends along the way, Time to grab
				a pickaxe and start the climb! Reaching Mt. Olympus takes a lot of climbing but along the way, you discover these mana
				geysers which look like they can be harvested with a pickaxe. You also discover runes scattered around the mountain, maybe
				deciphering them might be useful? Finally, about half way up this mountain, you discover a massive cavern with room to take a
				break climbing and explore it. You met these Friendly Trolls in these caverns. Sadly, they don't sell snowcones...
			</story>
			<story num="6"> <!--Good Reputation Story--> <!--Change 6 to Valhalla-->
				You have finally reached the top of Mt. Olympus! There is a giant door at the very top and a voice rings out: "Mortal! You stand
                to be JUDGED by the GODS! Step forth and face JUDGEMENT!" After waiting for what feels like hours, the voice rings out once more: 
                "You may PASS!". You enter the wonderful, otherwoldly home of the gods, Valhalla, where... you spot a tourist guide almost immediately.
                Unexpected as the guide is, having a God show you around turns out to be well worth the money. Several Gods busy themselves with 
                house-to-house charity collections, there are museums and shops where you can find wonders beyond the reaches of mere mortals,
                and you even learn there are opportunities to become a registered citizen, even as a mere mortal! Whether you want to study at the
                Wizard's college or fight alongside the Valkyries, there are many benefits to living among the Gods.

			<story num="7"> <!--Bad Reputation Story--> <!--Change 7 to Startington-->
                A booming voice rings out as the clouds part overhead, and you instinctively cover your ears as every word makes your bones rattle:
                "YOU HAVE BEEN JUDGED!" The world around you becomes a blur, and it takes a second before you realize you are falling off the side of
                Mt. Olymups. Even as the wind pulls on your skin, you can tell that you're not just falling in a physical sense as the world around
                you is drained of every last bit of colour, the last streak of purple light off in the distance by the time you realize you've stopped
                falling some time ago. Pushing yourself to your feet, you look around and find yourself right in front of a very familiar town-gate.
                The purple light is coming from a massive pillar reaching up from the center of town, casting the only light for miles around in this,
                the Shadow Realm. Oh, and the sign on the gates states this place is called "Startington." Evidently, you're not in any familiar territory
                any more.

			<story num="8"> <!--Change 8 to Jungle Path-->
                Shadow realm or not, there are enough things that haven't changed that you still lean on your established routine. Right down
                to the part where you have to get some supplies to brave the jungle just outside the small town, from a local trader. Too bad
                this one is quite selectively deaf to your attempts at haggling, but hey. You've gotten good enough at budgeting and scrounging
                up coins that you could pay him in the end. Turning your eyes to the narrow trail through the dense jungle before you, you set
                foot among the wild trees, noting the ruins among the tree-trunks. Wonder if this place had always been a jungle...

			<story num="9"> <!--Made the Looping Potion--> <!--Change 9 to Looping Potion-->
                Learning the finer points of alchemy, of the subtle rules underpinning the "simple" brewing of potions had been a long, exhausting
                trial, but since you have nothing but time on your hands, you have become an expert by any standard. As you let a bundle of herbs
                soak in a mana geyser, you double-check your notes and prepare your equipment. The brew itself is finnicky but finally, you fill
                a bottle with the fruits of your Great Work. The Loop Potion, the exact same brew that got you into this situation. 
                ...Reflecting for a moment, you wonder if there was much of a point to all of this. Not like making more of the stuff will get you
                out of the loops.
			</story>
			<story num="10"> <!--Change 10 to Commerceville-->
                Exploring the jungle ruins took quite a lot of time, and you just barely manage to make your way to the other side before the imposing
                gate among the trees closes. You mentally take note that you're on a time limit if you want to make it here on future loops, and that
                the pattern of the "normal" world still holds: On the other side of the jungle lies a small-ish city that proudly identifies itself
                as "Commerceville, the heart of trade!" according to the statue along the way to the city gates. While just wandering is liable to get
                you in trouble with some of the townsfolk, there is a helpful tourist guide willing to show you around for a "reasonable" sum. Even if
                the guide looks a little too eager to lead you down the city's many narrow alleyways, you can't deny that learning about the Thieves guild
                was worth the risk to get there. Finally, at the end of the tour, you learn that your guide also works for the tax collectors and really
                can't stay to chat. At least your guide was nice enough to show you to the Bank. There is an imposing hooded figure leaning against a wall
                of the bank, maybe they can tell you something more...

                <![CDATA[
                    You can't help but chuckle as you make your way out of the Bank's "Big Shot" office, keys to the <i>entirety</i> of Commerceville in hand.
                    Sure, the loan wasn't cheap and you'd probably get into a lot of trouble if you'd stick around for the first payment, but there's no way
                    your mana reserves will last that long. Looking ahead, you blink at the first blatant difference between this world and the normal one:
                    There is no Mt. Olympus. Instead, there is a large, wide valley with the ruins of a tower in the middle of it. It takes a bit of Doing,
                    but you eventually find a stone covered in familiar runic script: "Children of the land! We, the seven guardian deities, challenge you!
                    Find us, fight us, and claim the throne of the gods!" ...Oh well, time for a bit of deicide. The "throne of the gods" sounds like just the
                    kind of thing that could break you out of the loops, and they <i>did</i> issue a challenge for anyone to find. Step one will be to reach them.

            <explanation><![CDATA[
          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by a percentage.<br>
          Talent exp gain is equal to 1% of stat exp gain, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multiplies xp gain by (1+(talentLevel)^0.4/3).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) per tick.<br>
          Total Mult is the product of your talent and soulstone bonuses.<br><br>
          e.g. Meet People costs 800 mana and has a breakdown of <div class="bold">Int</div> 10% <div class="bold">Cha</div> 80% <div class="bold">Soul</div> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 80 of the mana is controlled by <div class="bold">Int</div>, another 80 by <div class="bold">Soul</div>, and the remaining 640 by <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          If your <div class="bold">Cha</div> is level 20 when the action is started, the bonus would be x1.2 so it'd be 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <div class="bold">Soul</div> and <div class="bold">Int</div>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 694, so ~87% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (800/694)*(1+(talent)^0.4/3) level exp per mana for the 694 mana.]]></explanation>

She fell for him and him for her, it was a love for the ages she tells you while drunk from the wine you brought along with you. He wanted to run away with her and she agreed, too love struck to question why. He was running from deals he had made and bargains he had forsaken, his glib tongue landing him in trouble of the otherworldly nature. Trisha seems frustrated with her youth's naivety as she tells you how she was made a scapegoat for his failings and forfeits in his deals and bargains. How she was essentially sold to the dark gods as his forfeit. When you ask what she did in return, all Trisha does is smile with dark satisfaction, the fire flaring briefly.]]></story_8>

Well, the clearing itself wasn't really large enough on its own. It was a dense cluster of clearings that you've taken mana from that you could easily clear out to make a ritual space. Preparing the altar is surprisingly tame, all said and done. Stone and wood comprise most of the altar and the rest you brought with you when you made this plan. In the end the altar you build is only small, a communion point instead of a summoning. Holding a heart from nearby deer, you pierce it and begin to chant ritualistic words of power. The clearing grows dark and the forest quietens, nary a sound is heard apart from the drip drip drip of the blood from the pierced heart in your hand. The blood you've spilled on the altar begins to blacken and swirl without outside force and eventually forms into a small face, disgusting to look at but enough to communicate through.]]></story_1>

			<story_2><![CDATA[<b>E Rank achieved:</b>⮀ You've clawed your way out of the ranks of the common riffraff. You still don't stand out at all, but it feels good to not be on the bottom rung anymore.]]></story_2>
			<story_3><![CDATA[<b>D Rank achieved:</b>⮀ They say you're good for a new recruit, but it's still with a bored tone and an apathetic face. It seems even though you're getting much better scores nobody actually cares yet. Well, at least you're better off than the people stuck in F-rank.]]></story_3>
			<story_4><![CDATA[<b>C Rank achieved:</b>⮀ People seem to actually respect you now, all of a sudden. Apparently it's pretty common for people to fail to make it higher than E or D and quit, but those who make it to C-rank are in for the long haul. You're being treated like a comrade in arms now, and it feels good.]]></story_4>
			<story_5><![CDATA[<b>B Rank achieved:</b>⮀ Now people are starting to take note. B-rank adventurers don't come around every day, and most of them started lower and climbed their way up. That you came out of nowhere and placed B-rank on arrival is stirring up quite a few rumours.]]></story_5>

Rumours fly, and some are even saying that you're an A-rank previously thought dead, disguised under a new identity. All the attention makes you uncomfortable, but at this point it's hard to avoid.]]></story_6>
			<story_7><![CDATA[<b>S Rank achieved:</b>⮀ There's only one other S-rank adventurer around, Guildmaster Rannet himself. There aren't any rumours of you being a fake identity this time, because S-rank adventurers are so rare that Rannet personally knows all of them and he's convinced he's never seen you before. Instead, people whisper about everything from the legacy of heroes to divine blood and everything in-between. At this point the only things that could explain your existence are implausible, and you can't really disagree with that assessment.]]></story_7>
			<story_8><![CDATA[<b>U Rank achieved:</b>⮀ You stand above even Rannet now, and you're told the only person who compares is the strongest Guildmaster, Diphon "Living Earthquake" Granwell. Word spreads like wildfire and you become an instant celebrity. Everyone seems to want you to go challenge Diphon to see who's the strongest, but you know that you'd run out of mana long before you even get close to his city.]]></story_8>

"...You live yet," the ferryman whispers louder than an earthquake, "why do you seek passage?" Rather than explaining yourself, you hold up a heavy pouch of coins. Charon, as you somehow know the ferryman is named, silently nods and gestures for you to board. The trip across the waters is silent, steady and... boring. However, the moment you set foot on the Far Shore, the world twists around you and you are suddenly standing in front of Commerceville's gates! ...If this is the afterlife, you'd rather stay alive a little longer.]]></story_1>

			<story_1><![CDATA[<b>1 Chronomancy:</b>⮀ Chronomancy is unlike any other magic you've practiced, and unbelievably finnicky. The mana has to be held perfectly still, as if time is at a standstill, and the slightest mistake will cause the entire spell to destabilize. It's hard work, but you finally get the hang of it and you feel yourself speed up by the barest fraction.]]></story_1>

With a snap, the entire length of the wood catches fire all at once, turning into a cozy camp fire. Mundane as such a trick may seem, making fire just from the friction between your fingers is the kind of fire mastery the ancient masters could only dream of! ...Briefly, the idea of an army of women in mini skirts comes to mind, but you push that weird thought to the side.]]></story_4>

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>Attempted to attend:</b>⮀ You haven't even crossed the threshold of the ornate building, and already you <i>know</i> you're out of place here. The various young gods making their way past you barely give you a glance in passing as you make your way up to the testing office. Unsurprisingly, the first time you try ends with you just barely qualifying as a bottom-rank Initiate.]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Student" rank:</b>⮀ It's taken many, <i>many</i> loops, but you finally manage to scrounge together enough magical knowhow to impress the test-taking mages. At least, you assume "bursting into flame" is an expression of approval, given how apparently one of the mages was there exclusively to throw a bucket of water at the test-takers.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Disciple" rank:</b>⮀ Getting used to watching people go up in flames and then commend you while their clothes are still wet from getting doused still feels weird, but you're definitely moving up. Better yet: you now have a council-appointed mentor! He's quite gruff and seemingly impossible to please, but trying to meet his heavens-high standards has taught you much in and of itself.]]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Magician" rank:</b>⮀ The test takers still regularly go up in flames, but by now they've stopped assigning you to a mentor. Instead, you have shown enough skill and mastery to be awarded the opportunity to properly graduate, once you complete a thesis!]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Great Wizard" rank:</b>⮀ For once, your test-takers refrain from combusting, and you're told to wait outside while they discuss your performance. While you initially worry about being accused of cheating, when they call you back in they tell you quite the opposite: You have demonstrated the kind of mastery that would earn a student some special consideration! Instead of offering to enroll you, the college allows you to take your final tests right there and then, which you pass with flying colors!]]></story_5>
            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Archwizard" rank:</b>⮀ You barely make it halfway through your routine before the world blurs around you, the walls of the office folding inside out as an immense room, looking much like a courthouse, takes shape around you. One of the black-robed people on the lower banks clears their throat. "Student! We of the Council have deemed you exceptional. Show to us your mastery, and join our ranks!" Once more, you actually struggle to impress your unexpected judges, but by the end you're offered the black robes of an Archwizard!]]></story_6>
            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Great Sage" rank:</b>⮀ Even watching the little office melt away and the councilchamber of the Wizards' Council take its place loses some of its grandeur by now, and you definitely pick up on some whispering between the councilmembers. This time around, you are prepared and by the end of your demonstration, one of the Archwizards goes up in a blaze! ...She was quite embarrassed about it afterwards, but the council did grant you the title of Great Sage, along with the stone-grey robes of your new station.]]></story_7>
            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Archsage" rank:</b>⮀ The members of the council are extremely experienced, gifted and difficult to impress, but your mastery of the Aether around you by now regularly sets off the entire lower banks of seats in a bonfire of approval. Rather than just a slightly whiter robe, you are now offered a deep red robe, along with a curled staff as you are promptly promoted to the coveted rank of Archsage!]]></story_8>
            <story_9><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Great Magus" rank:</b>⮀ While the early parts of your demonstration light the council ablaze, the Chair of the Council of Seven raises a hand. "Student. You stand here before us as an unknown, but you wield your might with a grace and dedication that even I am impressed by. How has an unknown like yourself managed to evade our scrutiny yet attain such immense prowess?" Odd wording of the question aside, you hurriedly come up with some not-technically-lies about you being a savant in the magical arts. While none of the high-ranking councilmembers buy it, you are still awarded the deep blue robes of a Great Magus. You suspect they gave you the rank to better keep an eye on you, frankly.]]></story_9>
            <story_10><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Archmagus" rank:</b>⮀ This time around, you don't even bother with the front door of the College, and instead perform the magical equivalent of knocking on the door of the Council's pocket dimension. Once you feel their approval for you to enter, you smoothly step in and give a polite bow to the council as every eye in the cavernous room is pointed at you. After a quick introduction, you point your finger at one of the Archmagi seated just below the Council of Seven and challenge him for his title, to the shock of everyone present! The duel itself is gruelling, as much for you as for your opponent, but by the end he yields to you. You can barely stand as he takes his vividly purple cloak off and drapes it over your shoulders.]]></story_10>
            <story_11><![CDATA[<b>Reached "Chair of the Council of the Seven" rank:</b>⮀ Time is precious this time, as you promptly step up to the council and challenge the Chair for the title. As is tradition for such a challenge, the other six members promptly rise and attack you together, but you endure the onslaught long enough to take them down one by one. While you are out of breath, the Chair gets up and calmly walks over to you, leaning in to whisper something in your ear: "Are you trying to take on the Seven?" You respond with only a nod, to which the Chair calmly takes off the bright white cloak with golden edges and puts it on your shoulders, the weight very nearly snapping your legs under you. "Then do not disappoint, and do not let the Seven wait," the former Chair says before walking out of the councilroom, leaving you to take the vacated seat of power.]]></story_11>

Unlocking the door took ages, you had no way to grab most of the loot, and the warehouse guards nearly managed to grab you. All that, and you only managed to grab a few small knicknacks.]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>10% of warehouses robbed:</b>⮀ This time, you spend a while practicing your lockpicking before you try again. The guard still spots you though, and you have to leave most of the loot in-place, but at least you got a better haul this time.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>20% of warehouses robbed:</b>⮀ Since the guard has been a wrench in your plans every time, you make sure to knock him out on this trip. His patrol route is the same every loop anyway, so sneaking up from behind isn't much of a problem.]]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>40% of warehouses robbed:</b>⮀ You convinced a few of your guildmates to help you out this time. While you're still doing most of the work yourself, having a few extra hands to carry the loot out means that you practically clear the warehouse's various valuables before the guard gets back up!]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>60% of warehouses robbed:</b>⮀ The Boss has gotten wind of your ability to coordinate an effective warehouse robbery, and insists that you get involved in a larger heist: one of the trading companies is going to hold an art auction soon, and the Boss wants a few pieces "cheaply." The warehouse is a lot better protected, though...]]></story_5>
            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>80% of warehouses robbed:</b>⮀ Scoping out the auction's warehouse confirms your suspicions.

One of your crewmembers expresses his concerns that the trading company will be out for blood, but the Boss insists that it's all insured so they'll get their money. ...Insurance, huh?

More specifically, the insurance company is immediately suspicious that someone who signed up with them three minutes ago immediately has damages to declare, and only your silver tongue keeps them off your back until the end of the loop.]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>10% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ Slowly but surely, you're getting a little smarter. This time around, your insurance agent gives you a suspicious glare before handing over the agreed-upon sum after you put on a sob story of how you were beaten up right in front of the office and had your watch stolen! If anything, it's a little scary how eager your fellow guildmembers are to knock your teeth out.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>20% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ You had a realization during the planning phase of this loop's fraud: If the insurance company gets suspicious due to insured items suffering damage within a day, then the "obvious" solution is to do a little impersonation and cut with both sides of the knife. Your guildmates snatch the priceless artifacts, then you convince the insurers that yes, <i>you</i> are in fact the owner and should be compensated. Now just to get better at disguising yourself.]]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>40% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ While stealing entire buildings is not quite an option, there is a lot of money to be made by 'informing' rivaling trading companies that the other group is working with the thieves that fleeced them last week, and that they won't get their stuff back because the Guard's been bought. Sure, none of them are exactly <i>happy</i> with it, but they're all to eager to pay you for the information once you sweeten the deal with the patrol schedules, and snatching up some insurance claims once the rival warehouse has burned down is a nice bonus too.]]></story_4>

The man in question has been put in a hairy situation by his insurance company, and is now discussing how to get revenge.

Pressing her for a bit, you learn that there is a certain "secret" guild in town that handles murder and assassination, who are none to eager to let some upstart start killing without paying their guild dues...]]></story_6>
            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>100% of fraud committed:</b>⮀ The biggest problems in defrauding an insurance company are always related to making sure you don't get caught in a lie, so you've taken to visiting their officess off-hours and making some adjustments to some of the documentation related to your cases. This time however, you spot a folder you haven't seen before in the insurance company's director's office. It's a thin, black folder simply labled <i>in case of problems</i>. Inside, you find contact information for the Assassin's guild. You try not to think why an insurance company would need such a thing as you sneak away.]]></story_7>

Turning a corner, you get to see the entrance to the Guild for less than a second before someone's got a knife pressed to your throat and demands you explain how you found this place. Joining the Assassin's guild definitely is going to be your largest achievement in smooth-talking to date, but by the end of it all you walk out with a list of targets in hand, several lessons in how to keep a heart beating outside of its body and a still-hurting brand under your armpit.]]></story_1>

Eventually, they get up and gesture to the side. Barely a word is exchanged the entire time, but shortly after you walk out of the hideout with a hefty sum of money and a <i>very</i> fancy wrist-mounted, automatically retracting and extending blade.

As you wipe the sweat from your brow, you take a break and just watch the presumed tower base for a while, admiring how the steady pulsing of the blocks' glyphs makes the lines between them glow.]]></story_6>
            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>Brought 999 stones to the tower:</b>⮀ Watching the second-to-last block hover over to the single, two-block-wide opening and slide in without so much as a scratch fills you with a determination you worried you might have lost. The end is in sight, now it's just a matter of bringing it all together! Gods, beware, for you are coming!]]></story_7>

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>Beheld the tower:</b>⮀ Carrying that last block of stone felt easier than any of the others, whether the combined attraction of the properly placed stones pulled it along or if the end being in sight gave you the motivation you needed. However, you barely get time to cheer as it slides into place and fills the final remaining gap before the blocks start rising up into the air, threads of light connecting them and interlinking until you are looking at a tower made of a hundred floating, glowing platforms. Already you can see the light of Valhalla shining at the very top while a set of blocks forms a staircase up to the first glowing floor. Also, there suddenly is a bunch of monsters between you and said stairs, better get busy and kill them fast!]]></story_1>

            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>Cleared 60 floors in one loop:</b>⮀ The golems just make you feel sad somehow. Their design is a little too angular, a little too flawed to be the work of the gods. You wonder whose craftsmanship you're breaking on the way up.]]></story_7>

            <story_1><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Athena:</b>⮀ Athena, protector of cities, approaches you with her shield held reolutely and unflinchingly. Your every blow bounces off of her defences and whenever you overcommit, she is quick to punish your agression with a swift shield-slam to the back of your head. Fighting her demands that you meet her carefully considered defences with your own intellect.]]></story_1>
            <story_2><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Athena with 500k Dexterity talent:</b>⮀ As the fight drags on, the rest of the Pantheon watching you and Athena exchange blows, you start to find ways around her imposing defences. A dance-like move here that just barely lets you get a light hit in to her side, a graceful dive over her shield there that buys you exactly enough time for a quick slap there... The fight is no less gruesome, but over time the light hits add up and eventually, Athena shakes her head and steps back, acknowledging her defeat.]]></story_2>
            <story_3><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Ares</b>⮀ Befitting a god of War and Courage, Ares announces himself with a wordless war-cry followed by him drawing a sword and shield, charging at you with all the ferocity of an entire army. You're barely left standing after that first charge and have to scramble to meet the next, kept on the back foot while Ares demands you fight him 'properly.']]></story_3>
            <story_4><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Ares with 500k Strength talent:</b>⮀ By the third charge, you've figured out much of what Ares is doing. You brace yourself while he turns for another charge, meeting him head-on and catching his shield with both hands. Ares barely has time to look surprised before you lift him off his feet and, with a scream rivalling his own, slam him down hard on the glowing floor while yanking the shield off of his arm. You prepare to punch him in the face, but he shakes his head and acknowledges his defeat, nudging you off of him with noticeable effort and returning to his seat as the next goddess takes to the field.]]></story_4>
            <story_5><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Demeter:</b>⮀ Watching the Goddess of the Harvest pull out a scythe as she approaches was something you more or less expected. Having her use such an impractical weapon with enough skill to nearly take your head off on the first swing is something you really should have seen coming, but sadly didn't.]]></story_5>
            <story_6><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Demeter with 500k Constitution talent:</b>⮀ The best way to handle a fight is to end it quickly, but Demeter is not giving you that chance. Her attacks are as relentless as an entire community trying to pull in a large harvest before bad weather can destroy the crops, and soon you're covered in gashes along your arms and back where her scythe slipped past your defences. In a desparate attempt to end this before you bleed out, you rush into one of her swings, gritting your teeth through the pain as the blade digs into your back while you keep the handle pinned with your arm as you slam Demeter in her face with your free hand. The shock is enough to make her lose her grip and back away, but before you can deliver a finishing blow, you hear something whistle through the air...]]></story_6>
            <story_7><![CDATA[<b>Dodged poison darts:</b>⮀ Still riding the adrenaline burst of your previous fight, you jump back as a flock of black feathers dig into the glowing floor, the acrid smoke rising from the very tips informing you that you really, <i>really</i> don't want to take more hits from these than necessary.]]></story_7>
            <story_8><![CDATA[<b>Evaded poison darts with 500k Speed talent:</b>⮀ At first, you just dodge and weave through the cloud of feathers zipping past you, but the longer it goes on, the more easily you can read the pattern. Still, you don't like the idea of just letting the gods harrass you like this, so you change tactics. Your hands dart out to the sides, catching several of the feathers between your fingers (giving you a split second to realize they're really metal knives with feather fletchings,) and throwing them back hard at the clouds from which they're being launched. There is a bit of commotion as a bunch of glowing figures squeal and run, causing Artemis to roll her eyes before elbowing Poseidon to get up.]]></story_8>
            <story_9><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Poseidon:</b>⮀ Fighting a guy with a trident is well within your abilities. Fighting one while getting shoved around by waves of seawater that follow in the wake of each strike is a hell of a lot harder, and keeping your balance long enough to not get kicked in the head by horses that weren't there five seconds ago isn't easy either.]]></story_9>
            <story_10><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Poseidon wiht 500k Perception talent:</b>⮀ It doesn't take long for you to start noticing how Poseidon works. If he sets up for a big swing while his trident is glowing, he's going to pull out a wave. If he sets up for a thrust, then you can bet on it that a horse is going to somehow pop out of his trident. Tracking his movements, you eventually manage to ride his waves into advantageous positions that let you get some good hits in while his back is turned! The fight ends when you dodge a thrust, using his trident as a springboard to land on the newly formed horse and have it deliver a double-hoof kick to Poseidon's face. The god of seas and horses looks quite grumpy as he wanders back to his seat, giving Artemis an 'all yours' nod while slumping down.]]></story_10>
            <story_11><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Artemis:</b>⮀ Artemis is, in a word, beautiful. You really don't get any time to appreciate that, though, as she promptly sends out a whole herd of shimmering deer that charge you horns first. The fight itself is another draining one; when she isn't having all sorts of forest critters gore you, she's keeping her distance and peppering you with more arrows than you think should fit in her quiver.]]></story_11>
            <story_12><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Artemis with 500k Charisma talent:</b>⮀ Charming the famously chaste goddess is a non-starter, but you quickly figure out that the shimmering herds she summons at you is really just a single herd getting called and dismissed over and over. Taming the wild animals takes quite a bit of effort, but with every cycle of Artemis summoning them to charge you between volleys of arrows, you get a little further. Soon enough, the herd starts deliberately parting ways to avoiding hitting you and a few of the deer even stop by you for a quick pat, much to Artemis' chagrin. Finally, you convice the largest member of the herd to let you mount them while turning to face Artemis, leaving her to scramble out of the way as her own herd turns against her. You barely get a second to enjoy the look of offence she's giving you before a red blur shoots past your face. "...Dang, was sure that one would hit," you hear Apollo complain as he takes to the field.]]></story_12>

            <story_13><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Apollo:</b>⮀ Apollo is- "Yeah yeah, I know I like to talk!" ...a chatterbox, which makes fighting him- "an utter delight, I'm sure. Anyway, before you ask: no, I do not know why I can make these balls, and frankly I don't really care," he explains while- "While making you look like the slow kid at PE," ...by repeatedly hitting you in the face with rough-textured red balls. "Dodge!"]]></story_13>
            <story_14><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Apollo with 500k Intelligence talent:</b>⮀ While the balls aren't nearly as painful as the last few gods' weapons, you soon learn that Apollo has a <i>very</i> good throwing arm. "Why thank you! It also helps that I know exactly where to hit you to make it hurt," he helpfully adds while giving you a playful wink. The longer the fight drags on, the more you feel like he's not taking it seriously at all as he effortlessly dodges anything you throw at him while repeatedly throwing balls at you. "That is because I don't!" he shouts while casually tossing a ball up and down, "this is all just a bit of good fun for me!" Thinking about it for a little longer, you drop your weapons and turn your back on Apollo as you sit down. "...Really now?" Apollo groans while lobbing his ball at the back of your head, "That's how you're going to try and beat me? By making this boring? ...Well, can't deny it's working. Spoilsport," he grumbles before taking his ball and presumably going home. Who knew! Sometimes, the only winning move is to not play!]]></story_14>
            <story_15><![CDATA[<b>Avoided lightning bolts:</b>⮀ One moment, you're trying to catch your breath after dealing with Apollo. The very next, you're screaming while light, sound and pain fill your senses, and you fall to your knees. Struggling to look up, you see Zeus pull back his arm and prepare another lightning bolt. Time to move!]]></story_15>
            <story_16><![CDATA[<b>Walked through the lightning with 500k Luck talent:</b>⮀ Try as you might, there is no rhyme or reason to the pattern of the bolts relentlessly striking down around you. Out of other options, you stand up straight and close your eyes, praying to... well, not the gods this time, that you make it through this time. You can still hear the lightning bolts striking down around you, can still feel the heat against your skin as you keep putting one foot in front of the other, the bolts coming faster with every step. Still, the only thing that stops you from going further is your foot bumping into the dais, the shock making you open your eyes and look up. Zeus is looking back at you, one eyebrow raised, before getting up to face you.]]></story_16>
            <story_17><![CDATA[<b>Challenge Zeus:</b>⮀ The King of the Gods looks at you for a moment, a lightning bolt crackling in his hand as he rises from his throne. You have no idea how, but the next moment your face is pressed down against the glowing floor from the sheer pressure Zeus exudes. You grit your teeth until you can feel your molars start to crack as you force yourself to your feet for this final fight.]]></story_17>
            <story_18><![CDATA[<b>Defeat Zeus with 500k Soul talent:</b>⮀ In the presence of the gods, mortals bow. Whether they want to or not, the sheer <i>weight</i> of the King of Gods' aura alone will make the strongest knees buckle. You, however, have faced this weight so many times through the loops that, while you can still feel it trying to force you down and prostrate yourself before him, you manage to hold your own. Zeus looks surprised for exactly one moment, and then your fist connects with his cheek. The longer the fight drags on, the less you feel the weight of his aura force you down, and the more Zeus himself seems to struggle to keep standing as the brawl drags out. Finally though, you manage to land a firm blow to the back of Zeus' knee, forcing him down into a kneeling pose. "...Enough," he says while rising to his feet. You brace for him to start using his bolts again, but instead he steps to the side and gives you a nod. The throne of the Gods, for you to claim.]]></story_18>

You have seen more, done more in one day than most people do in a lifetime by a wide margin, but now it is over. Reaching out, you... no, I see the world through new eyes, and my hand gently reaches for the fraying thread of time, worn down by the many times my return to the start severed its many strands. Carefully, I weave my newfound power around one severed strand, making it grow into a full timeline in its own right, one in which I got into some trouble for running around Beginnersville looking for locks to pick. In another, I make friends with the Witch of the Forest Path. Yet another, I become a famous crafter, settling down in Merchanton after winning a large Architecture competition.
